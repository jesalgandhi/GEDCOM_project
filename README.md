# How to run:
`script.py` is the main file to be executed along with the main gedcom file (`test_file.ged`)

```
python script.py test_file.ged
```
## Additional files
Additional files like `sprint1.py` contain code for their respective sprint numbers. Additional gedcom files like `sprint1_test.ged` are used to test each sprint's code.
